## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here - you're done a great job outlining a solid direction for your PWP. Based upon what I read here it also sounds like you have a well defined direction regarding the kind of opportunities you're looking for too - and that's awesome.

The main points you outlined in your Persona should direct and inform your design phase beginning in Milestone 2a. A few of the statements that really stood out to me were (in no particular order):
- "Alexandra needs to know whether I am going to be a smart worker, and not just a hard worker."
- "...good fit-design-wise..."
- "...needs someone who already has the basics, and preferably, some artistic skills."
- "...good with systems...and outcomes from design decisions...the ability to research and find solutions..."
- "...committed to empowering women..."
- "...seeking another full-stack web developer to add to her team, initially as an intern..."

I'm really looking forward to seeing how you choose to design your UI and content strategy in regards to these specifics. Professional presentation and style choices should also be a key concern as well. Unfortunately we don't delve into web graphic design in any real depth in this class (not enough time!), but since it is important I'll definitely share some resources with the class that might help with some direction and inspiration. Daniel Heron is also a great source of information and help regarding how to market yourself in IT, and how to find opportunities that are a good match to your talents and values. I'm really looking forward to seeing your project take shape.

Technically your project looks great - your code and repository/directory structure are all set up to spec.

Nice work - your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Go ahead and remove the autogenerated `<?php` tag and comment text in **milestone-1.php**. PhpStorm throws this in by default, and generally I just delete that stuff right off the bat. It's not needed for a document like this one, and I'm glad to see you closed the php tag so it didn't cause a parse error. :smiley:
